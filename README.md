This project aims to predict whether a borrower will default on a loan based on their financial and demographic data.
By analyzing customer profiles, the model provides insights that can help financial institutions reduce risk and make informed lending decisions.

ðŸ”¹ Current Status

Implemented data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling).

Trained baseline ML models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.).

Achieved moderate accuracy, but there is scope for improvement.

ðŸ”¹ Future Improvements

Expanding the dataset with more real-world financial features.

Applying ensemble methods & advanced models (XGBoost, LightGBM, Neural Networks).

Performing hyperparameter tuning for better performance.

Evaluating fairness & bias in predictions to ensure ethical use.

Deploying the model as a simple web application/dashboard for real-time predictions.
